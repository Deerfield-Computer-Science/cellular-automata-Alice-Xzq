1, The execution starts in WorldController class. Three iterations pass in the world. 
You can change the amount of iterations by changing the for loop's end condition in runWorld().
You can also change the number(ms) in the pause function to increase the time in between each iteration.

2, The execution starts in WorldController class. Then it goes to World class to construct a new world. 
Then the program goes to Location and Grass class to create corresponding objects. 
Then it draw the world and change the world (letTimePass + drawWorld) multiple times according to the for loop's condition.

3, There are two ways:
One way is to change myColor variable in Plant class, but that will change all the plant's color.
Another way is to comment out the declaration line of myColor in Plant class and add a line with another color in Grass class.

4, Each Grass will add a new grass in random location (0 to 20 for both x and y) to the creature list

5, Add a 2-D boolean array to record which locations had been taken in World, write a while true loop until the random
genarated location was not taken.

6, The creatures were stored in an ArrayList of LifeForm in World and were accessed through the ArrayList

7, Remove the dead creatures out of the list so they don't get drawn again.

8, Creatures have a location because location is the porperty of a creature

9, The world have creatures, because a world can hold a lot of creatures while one creature can't live in multiple worlds.

10, You could add a move function in that creature's class and randomly add or minus one on the creature's x or y
